## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - JS with syntax for types.
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) - A utility-first CSS framework

### What I learned

This is my first project in Frontend Mentor. I learned a lot about React by using it with typescript. I was struggling a lot when I used
the Context API for the first time with typescript but it helps me to better graps the essence of modern frontend development. I fall in
love when I used a React design pattern called **COMPOUND COMPONENT**. I learn that it is better to use it when you render card where some of
the cards have different structure. I'm looking foward to do more frontend projects from Frontend mentor because I know for sure I can be
profficient in frontend by doing their challenges.

### Continued development

I still want to focus on the context API and better use it because I think it can enhance the flexibility of maintaining a project and better
managing the states.

### Useful resources

- [How to use the compound component design pattern](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPRdY87_SH0&pp=ygUZY29tcG91bmQgY29tcG9uZW50cyByZWFjdA%3D%3D) - This helped me for using the compound component design pattern. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.

some service providers
